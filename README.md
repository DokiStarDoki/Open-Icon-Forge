- Semi-automated AI icon generation pipeline
- Crisp black-and-white SVGs, vector-ready
- Theme-based folder and file structure
- Lightweight, scalable metadata via per-icon .json files
- Manual-first dashboard with eventual automation
- Easily browsable with the in-browser viewer

## Folder Structure

```
/icons/
    /theme-name/
        icon-name.svg    # The icon
        icon-name.json   # The icon metadata

/incoming/
    input.json           # Used for staging icon + metadata before organization

/scripts/
    organize_icons.py    # Moves SVG + JSON to correct folders

metadata.json            # Global tracker (used themes, icon list)
dashboard.json           # UI-state tracker (backlogs, selections, generation state)
index.html               # Icon browser + metadata viewer

## Metadata Format

### metadata.json

Lightweight tracker used for indexing themes and listing all created icons:

```json
{
  "themes_used": ["Space", "Underwater"],
  "icons_created": [
    {
      "file": "icons/space/space-station.svg",
      "name": "Space Station",
      "theme": "Space"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Per-Icon .json

Each icon has its own JSON file with rich details:

```json
{
  "name": "Space Station",
  "short_description": "A simple satellite-style space station icon",
  "tags": ["space", "station", "satellite", "orbit"],
  "theme": "Space",
  "date_created": "2025-04-28"
}
```
